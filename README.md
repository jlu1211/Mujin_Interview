# Mujin Pallet Feasibility Checker

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a pallet of fixed size and a set of boxes with fixed dimensions (L × W × H) and fixed quantities, determine whether all boxes can fit on a **single layer** of a pallet in a **stable** arrangement.

Stability in this simplified model is defined as:

1. Selecting **four boxes of the same height** to serve as the four pallet corners.
2. Ensuring that the **remaining boxes** can fit inside the **remaining usable pallet area** without overlapping.
3. Boxes are not rotatable — each dimension is fixed.

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Corner Placement Heuristic**

- Automatically finds **four boxes with identical height**.
- Places them at the four extremes of the pallet (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) to form a stable outer frame.

### 2. **2D Grid Engine (Geometry-Aware)**

- **Discretized Grid**: Models the pallet as a binary Matrix (`numpy` array) where `0` is empty and `1` is occupied.
- **Collision Detection**: Strictly enforces geometric boundaries. Boxes cannot overlap or extend beyond the pallet edges.
- **Visualization**: Generates ASCII text files to visualize the exact physical layout of the boxes. When running the test suite, layouts are saved in the `layout_result/` folder with names like `test_1_greedy.txt`, `test_1_dp.txt`, etc.

### 3. **Dual Solver Strategies**

The project now includes two distinct algorithms to solve the packing problem:

#### A. Greedy Solver (`greedy.py`)

- **Algorithm**: First-Fit Decreasing.
- **Logic**: Sorts all remaining boxes by area (Largest to Smallest) and places them in the first available spot on the grid.
- **Pros**: Extremely fast (<10ms).
- **Cons**: Can fail to find a solution even if one exists (due to fragmentation).

#### B. Recursive Backtracking Solver (`dp_backtrack.py`)

- **Algorithm**: Depth-First Search (DFS) with Backtracking.
- **Logic**: Tries to place a box; if successful, recurses to the next box. If it reaches a dead end, it **backtracks** (removes the box) and tries the next coordinate.
- **Pros**: Exact. If a solution exists, it will find it.
- **Cons**: Slower than greedy (exponential time complexity in worst case). Includes verbose logging to trace the decision tree.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Run Individual Solvers

#### Greedy Solver
Fast check for feasibility. Saves layout to `layout_greedy.txt`.

```bash
python greedy.py
```

#### Backtracking Solver
Exact solution finder. Saves layout to `layout_backtracking.txt`.

```bash
python dp_backtrack.py
```

### 2. Run Test Suite

Run all test cases from `test_cases.json` and compare both algorithms:

```bash
python test_runner.py
```

This will:
- Execute both greedy and backtracking algorithms on all test cases
- Display a comparison table with timing and pass/fail status
- Save all layout visualizations to the `layout_result/` folder:
  - `test_1_greedy.txt`, `test_1_dp.txt`
  - `test_2_greedy.txt`, `test_2_dp.txt`
  - ... and so on for each test case

The test runner creates the `layout_result/` directory automatically if it doesn't exist.
